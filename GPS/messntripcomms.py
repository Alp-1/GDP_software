RUN FROM WITHIN /examples FOLDER.

PLEASE RESPECT THE TERMS OF USE OF ANY NTRIP CASTER YOU
USE WITH THIS EXAMPLE - INAPPROPRIATE USE CAN RESULT IN
YOUR NTRIP USER ACCOUNT OR IP BEING TEMPORARILY BLOCKED.

This example illustrates how to use the UBXReader and
GNSSNTRIPClient classes to get RTCM3 RTK data from a
designated NTRIP caster/mountpoint and apply it to an
RTK-compatible GNSS receiver (e.g. ZED-F9P) connected to
a local serial port (USB or UART1).

GNSSNTRIPClient receives RTCM data from the NTRIP caster
and outputs it to a message queue. An example GNSSSkeletonApp
class reads data from this queue and sends it to the receiver,
while reading and parsing data from the receiver and printing
it to the terminal.

GNSSNtripClient optionally sends NMEA GGA position sentences
to the caster at a prescribed interval, using either fixed
reference coordinates or live coordinates from the receiver.

NB: Some NTRIP casters may stop sending RTK data after a while
if they're not receiving legitimate NMEA GGA position updates
from the client.
